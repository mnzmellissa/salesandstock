Sales & Stock – C# Project


Overview
This project was created to practice and consolidate C# development skills, focusing on:

Programming logic
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Clean Architecture principles
Unit testing
The application processes a provided XML file (Sales_Stock.xml), extracting and analyzing data related to product sales and inventory.

Artificial Intelligence Usage
Guidelines
AI should be used as a support tool, not as a shortcut.

Recommended usage:

Clarifying concepts
Reviewing logic and structure
Improving documentation
Organizing ideas
Avoid:

Generating full code solutions
Replacing the learning process
Core Concepts
Fundamentals
Programming logic
Control flow:
if, if-else
for, while
Object-Oriented Programming
Separation of concerns
Use of interfaces
Modular and organized structure
Readable and maintainable code
Best Practices
SOLID principles
Clean Code
Technologies
Language: C#
Testing Framework: NUnit
Unit Testing
Concepts Applied
AAA Pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
Mocking with MockRepository
Strict behavior using MockBehavior.Strict
Goals
Ensure reliability
Improve maintainability
Enable safe refactoring
Project Structure
The project follows a layered architecture, organized by responsibility:

/Domain
/Services
/Interfaces
/Infrastructure
/Tests
Features
The system reads and processes data from the Sales_Stock.xml file, providing the following functionalities:

Menu Options
Quantity of products in stock
Total sales value of products in stock
Best-selling product
Most profitable product
Products that have not been sold
Out-of-stock products
Execute all options
Exit
Objectives (Module 1 – Core)
This project aims to strengthen:

Logical reasoning in programming
Object-oriented design
Application of SOLID principles
Writing clean, maintainable code
Creating reliable unit tests
Participating in weekly code reviews
Proper use of XML documentation (
) for code readability and maintainability
Future Improvements (Module 2 – Advanced)
After completing the core module, the following improvements should be considered and implemented:

Error handling and exception management (invalid XML, unexpected failures)
Input and data validation (negative values, inconsistent data)
Handling duplicated products based on business rules (e.g., latest ModificationDate)
Improved domain modeling and responsibility separation
Writing more robust unit tests covering edge cases
Refactoring focused on readability and maintainability
Basic logging for system operations and errors
